# technical-skills

Hello!

Welcome to my technical skill showcase repository! Included are a variety of projects which I feel demonstrate the technical skills which I have accumulated throughout my time in school and in my career. In the event that you encounter organizational mistakes or incomplete projects, I apologize! Please understand that this repository also functions as a space for me to store and visualize the skills which I am still currently improving, or may like to continue to develop in the future, ie. this repository is a permanent work in progress! Thank you for understanding, and I encourage you to explore my projects, either to evaluate my skills, inspire your own projects, or to just mess around with some code. Thank you!
